    - notes:
        - I really overscoped the fck outta this proj. I wanted to try a bit of everything i guess. In hindsight that was the reason why I had to ice this
        - Because I didn't properly plan (and define the scope) the project, i often had to rewrite and rename stuff. And with thousands of lines, it took way too long everytime.
        - way too overscoped for a first game and solo dev proj.
        - One cool thing is i had 262 144 chunks, and 68 719 476 736 pixels per world
        - failure = !failure
